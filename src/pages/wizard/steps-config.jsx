            Each DB instance runs a <i>DB engine</i>. Amazon RDS supports several engine types: Amazon Aurora, MySQL,
            MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. Each DB engine has its own supported features, and
            each version of a DB engine might include specific features. Additionally, each DB engine has a set of
            parameters in a DB parameter group that control the behavior of the databases that it manages.

            When you launch an instance, the instance class that you specify determines the hardware of the host
            computer used for your instance. Each instance class offers different compute, memory, and storage
            capabilities. Choose an instance class based on the requirements of the application or software that you
            plan to run on your instance. Amazon RDS supports three types of instance classes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>General Purpose SSD</b> – General Purpose SSD volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a
              broad range of workloads. These volumes deliver single-digit millisecond latencies and the ability to
              burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods of time. Baseline performance for these volumes is determined by
              the volume's size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Provisioned IOPS SSD</b> – Provisioned IOPS storage is designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive
              workloads, particularly database workloads, that require low I/O latency and consistent I/O throughput.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Magnetic</b> – Amazon RDS also supports magnetic storage for backward compatibility. We recommend that
              you use General Purpose SSD or Provisioned IOPS for any new storage needs. The maximum amount of storage
              allowed for DB instances on magnetic storage is less than that of the other storage types.

            With IAM database authentication, you use an <i>authentication token</i> when you connect to your DB

            generate an authentication token, it's valid for 15 minutes before it expires. If you try to connect using
            an expired token, the connection request is denied.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every authentication token must be accompanied by a valid signature, using AWS signature version 4. You can
            use an authentication token when you connect to Amazon RDS from another AWS service, such as AWS Lambda. By
            using a token, you can avoid placing a password in your code.

          </p>
          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            Amazon VPC lets you launch AWS resources, such as Amazon RDS DB instances, into a VPC. A virtual private
            cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual
            networks in the AWS Cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use a VPC, you have control over your virtual networking environment. You can choose your own IP
            address range, create subnets, and configure routing and access control lists. The basic functionality of
            Amazon RDS is the same whether your DB instance is running in a VPC or not: Amazon RDS manages backups,
            software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery. There is no additional cost to run your DB
            instance in a VPC.
          </p>
          <p>All new DB instances are created in a default VPC unless you specify otherwise.</p>

    subnet: {

        <div>
          <p>
            A <i>subnet</i> is a segment of a VPC's IP address range that you designate to group your resources based on
            security and operational needs. A DB <i>subnet group</i> is a collection of subnets (typically private) that
            you create in a VPC and that you then designate for your DB instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each DB subnet group must have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a specified AWS Region. If you
            have a default VPC, the service automatically creates a subnet for you in each Availability Zone in the
            Region.
          </p>
          <p>
            When creating a DB instance in a VPC, you must choose a DB subnet group. Amazon RDS uses that DB subnet
            group and your preferred Availability Zone to select a subnet and an IP address within that subnet to
            associate with your DB instance. If the primary DB instance of a Multi-AZ deployment fails, Amazon RDS can
            promote the corresponding standby and subsequently create a new standby using an IP address of the subnet in
            one of the other Availability Zones.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>
            <br />
            For each DB instance that you run in a VPC, you should reserve at least one IP address in each subnet in the
            DB subnet group for use by Amazon RDS for recovery actions.

            A <i>VPC security group</i> controls access to DB instances (and EC2 instances) inside a VPC. The security
            groups acts as a firewall for the associated DB instance, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at
            the instance level. By default, the service creates a DB instance with a firewall and a security group that
            protect the DB instance.
          </p>
          <p>
            VPC security groups can have rules that govern both inbound and outbound traffic, although the outbound
            traffic rules typically don't apply to DB instances. Outbound traffic rules apply only if the DB instance
            acts as a client. For example, outbound traffic rules apply to an Oracle DB instance with outbound database

            Amazon RDS encrypted DB instances use the industry standard AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt your

            authentication of access and decryption of your data transparently, with a minimal effect on performance.

            standby replica in another Availability Zone. Each read replica is associated with a priority tier (0-3).
            Amazon RDS promotes the read replica that has the highest priority (the lowest numbered tier). If two or
            more replicas have the same priority, RDS promotes the one that is the same size as the previous primary
            instance.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary DB instance switches over automatically to the standby replica if any of the following
            conditions occur:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>An Availability Zone outage</li>
            <li>The primary DB instance fails</li>
            <li>The DB instance's server type is changed</li>
            <li>The operating system of the DB instance is undergoing software patching</li>
            <li>
              A manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using <b>Reboot with failover</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The failover mechanism automatically changes the DNS record of the DB instance to point to the standby DB
            instance. As a result, you need to re-establish any existing connections to your DB instance.

            <i>Backtracking</i> lets you quickly recover from a user error. Backtracking "rewinds" the DB instance to a
            time that you specify. For example, if you accidentally delete an important record at 10:00 AM, you could
            use backtracking to move a database back to its state at 9:59 AM, before the error.
          </p>
          <p>
            Backtracking is not a replacement for backing up your DB instance so that you can restore it to a point in
            time. However, backtracking provides the following advantages over traditional backup and restore:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can easily undo mistakes. If you mistakenly perform a destructive action, such as a DELETE without a
              WHERE clause, you can backtrack the DB instance to a time before the destructive action, with minimal
              interruption of service.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can backtrack a DB instance quickly. Restoring a DB instance to a point in time launches a new DB
              instance and restores it from backup data or a DB instance snapshot, which can take hours. Backtracking a
              DB instance doesn't require a new DB instance and rewinds the DB instance in minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can explore earlier data changes. You can repeatedly backtrack a DB instance back and forth in time to
              help determine when a particular data change occurred. For example, you can backtrack a DB instance three
              hours and then backtrack forward in time one hour. In this case, the backtrack time is two hours before
              the original time.

            Verify your settings for your DB instance, and edit the settings as needed. When you are satisfied with your
            settings, choose <b>Create DB instance</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Amazon RDS creates your instance, the new instance appears in the list of DB instances on the console.
            The DB instance has a status of <b>Creating</b> until the instance is ready to use. When the state changes
            to <b>Available</b>, you can connect to the instance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the instance class and the amount of storage, it can take up to 20 minutes before the new
            instance is available.
